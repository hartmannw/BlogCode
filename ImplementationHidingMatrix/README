This code is associated with a blog post on williamhartmann.wordpress.com about
hiding and encapsulating implementations using object oriented programming.

Matrix.h:
Contains an inefficient implementation of a two-dimensional matrix. Instead of
directly using the vector of vectors approach, it is encapsulated in this class.
This makes the code much more compact, cleaner, and readable. If a more
efficient implementation is needed, the code can be modified without affecting 
any of the code that uses the class.

test_matrix.cc
Contains a few simple tests of the Matrix class functionality.
