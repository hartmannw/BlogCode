This code is associated with a set of blog posts about modeling the solar system
on williamhartmann.wordpress.com

The text files contain postion information about a set of orbital bodies for a 
particular date.  The date is mm/dd/yyyy.  Each entry in the file contains three
lines.
1) Object name and mass
2) Ascension and declination information for the object at midnight on that day.
3) Ascension and declination information for the object at 1:00am on that day.

ModelSolarSystem.cc:
This is the main file.  It reads in the data from the txt files and sets up the
gravitational system.

OrbitalBody:
Class file that stores information about a given orbital object.

GravitationalSystem:
Class file that stores information for every object in the system.  Implements
the law of gravitation to set the whole system in motion.

StringFunctions:
Set of functions that are useful for manipulating strings.

Compilation:
Compilations should work on any system with g++ installed.  A makefile is
included.  To remove the compiled objects type "make clean" and to compile the
project type "make all".

USAGE:
./ModelSolarSystem datafile.txt number_of_days
This will print the information for the system in the given file and then
simulate the system for the prescribed number of days.  Finally it will ouput
the state of the gravitational system after simulation.
